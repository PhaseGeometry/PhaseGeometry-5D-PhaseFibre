# PhaseGeometry Z₂ — Minimal Binary Phase Framework

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources for the minimal (“strict”) Z₂ version of PhaseGeometry:
a binary (+/–) phase medium that accounts for effective dark energy, dark-matter-like halos
and compact objects within standard GR and scalar-field cosmology.

The current stable set of assumptions and equations is collected in the  
**PhaseGeometry Z₂ Core Package v2.5 (strict)** (Zenodo record, CC BY 4.0, DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.17807433`).

## Repository scope

This repository is limited to the Z₂ binary medium:
- double-well potential and effective Λ\_eff,
- background cosmology and the age of the Universe,
- dark-matter-like halos from defects,
- medium passports and compact-object notes.

Extensions such as **PhaseManifold** (continuous phase manifolds, Möbius structure)
and **5D phase–fibre geometry** live in separate PhaseGeometry series and repositories.
