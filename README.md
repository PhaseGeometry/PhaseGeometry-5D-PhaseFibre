# PhaseGeometry 5D PhaseFibre — Phase as a Compact Extra Dimension

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources for the **PhaseGeometry 5D PhaseFibre** programme:
a class of Kaluza–Klein–like models where the physical phase of fields is promoted to a
compact extra dimension. In the weak-field regime this yields an effective unification
language for gravity and electromagnetism within classical physics.

The series is designed to be readable on its own. Knowledge of the Z₂ binary framework
or the Manifold/Möbius series is helpful but not required.

## Repository scope

This repository is focused on 5D phase–fibre geometry and its weak-field phenomenology:

- phase as a compact S¹ fibre over 4D spacetime (M₅ = M₄ × S¹);
- effective 5D metric ansätze and their reduction to 4D GR + Maxwell electrodynamics;
- phase clocks, redshift and Josephson-type analogies in curved backgrounds;
- toy models for compact objects and phase–fibre structure around them;
- possible links to analogue-gravity setups and resonant devices.

Other parts of the PhaseGeometry programme are developed in separate repositories:

- **PhaseGeometry-Z2** — minimal binary (+/–) phase medium, dark energy and halos;
- **PhaseGeometry-Manifold** — continuous phase manifolds and Möbius-like internal geometry.

## Repository layout

- `foundations/` — core 5D PhaseFibre notes (metrics, reduction, basic equations).
- `phenomenology/` — weak-field applications, toy models, device-level sketches.
- `core/` (optional) — overviews, passports and roadmaps for the 5D series.
- `figures/` — shared plots and diagrams (if used).
