# PhaseGeometry 5D PhaseFibre — Phase as a Compact Extra Dimension

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources for the **PhaseGeometry 5D PhaseFibre** programme:
a class of Kaluza–Klein–like models where the physical phase of fields is promoted to a
compact extra dimension. In the weak-field regime this provides an effective unification
language for gravity and electromagnetism within classical physics.

The series is designed to be readable on its own. Knowledge of the Z₂ binary framework
or the Manifold/Möbius series is helpful but not required.

## Programme focus

This repository is focused on 5D phase–fibre geometry and its weak-field phenomenology:

- phase as a compact S¹ fibre over 4D spacetime (M₅ = M₄ × S¹);
- effective 5D metric ansätze and their reduction to 4D GR + Maxwell electrodynamics;
- phase clocks, redshift and Josephson-type analogies in curved backgrounds;
- toy models for compact objects and phase–fibre structure around them.

Dark-energy- and dark-matter-like effects, as well as strong-field black-hole structure,
are primarily treated in the Z₂ and Manifold series and appear here only as possible
analogies or future directions.

Other parts of the PhaseGeometry programme are developed in separate repositories:

- **PhaseGeometry-Z2** — minimal binary (+/–) phase medium, dark energy and halos.
- **PhaseGeometry-Manifold** — continuous phase manifolds and Möbius-like internal geometry.

## Repository layout

At the moment the material is organised as a single working set:

- `v2/` — current 5D PhaseFibre notes and figures: conceptual framework,
  field equations and phase clocks, Newtonian analogues, black-hole notes,
  technical passport draft and series roadmap.

Future versions may reorganise this into `foundations/`, `phenomenology/`
and `core/` folders, mirroring the structure of the Z₂ series.
